        <p class="text-muted mt-2 mb-0 pb-3">Everyone realizes why a new common language
          would be desirable: one could refuse to pay expensive translators.
          To achieve this, it would be necessary to have uniform grammar,
          pronunciation and more common words.</p>

          more simple and regular than that of the individual languages. The new common language will be more simple and
          regular than the existing European languages.</p>
